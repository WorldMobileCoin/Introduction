 - As a payment option - We noticed the growth of online store and most of them are using open source shopping cart. (OpenCart, PrestaShop, Magento, CubeCart, osCommerce, ext).
 What we will do - We will create a plugin/add on/extension that will integrate with WMCC network.
 - As base exchanger - As we can see, it's hard to get exchanger for unfamous cryptocurrency.
  What we will do - Our own exchanger open source website. For those who interest to running their own WMCC exchanger in the future, we will provide website source code. Just upload to your hosting, setting and your exchanger website is ready to operate. 
 - As game/mobile credit - Game and mobile user always growth day by day.But not all people do have credit card or bank account.
  What we will do - We will release a integration code to game/mobile developer to accept WMCC coin when user want to recharge their game/mobile account 
 ** We will monitor all other options from times that we think can increase the usage of WMCC.
 
 Until now that's all general information that we want to inform. We will always update this page with latest informations.
 We will also release others repo soon, when we establish our network. All sources and download files.
